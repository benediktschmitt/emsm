How to write a plugin
---------------------

It's very easy to create your own plugin.

#. You can read the :mod:`hellodolly` tutorial for a quick introduction.
#. If you want to know more and you're fit in Python, I suggest you read the 
   source code of the EMSM for a full overview. I guess this will not take more 
   than 1h of your time. Simply start with the :file:`EMSM_ROOT/minecraft.py` module 
   and follow the calls.   
   
New plugins
-----------

If you wrote a plugin, tell me about it on 
`GitHub <https://github.com/benediktschmitt/emsm>`_, so that I  can add it to 
this documentation. 

Please take also a look at the :ref:`contribute` page.
